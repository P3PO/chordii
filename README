Welcome to Chordie!

Chordie is a fork of Chord[1]. After multiple failed attempts to
contact the original authors, it was determined that Chord was
unmaintained. Luckily, Chord was licensed under the GPL, so it then
became Chordie so active development could continue.

Chordie's purpose is to provide guitar players with a tool to produce
good looking, self-descriptive music sheets from text files.

Chordie reads a text file containing the lyrics of a song, the chords
to be played, their description and some other optional data to
produce a PostScript document that includes:

	Centered titles
	Chord names above the words
	Graphical representation of the chords at the end of the songs
	Transposition

Chordie also provides support for:

	Multiple columns on a page
	Index of a songbook
	Multiple logical pages per physical pages (1, 2 or 4)
	Configurable fonts for the lyrics and the chord names
	Multiple songs inside one file
	The complete ISO 8859-1 character set
	Chorus marking

And, as they say, more... and even more to come!
