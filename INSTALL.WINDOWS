Basic Installation
==================

Building Chordii under Microsoft Windows requires the Microsoft C
compiler version 4.2 or later, and the `nmake' utility (comes with
MSC).

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.

  2. `cd' to the `windows' directory.

  3. Type `nmake'. This will compile and build `chordii.exe' and
     `a2crd.exe'.
