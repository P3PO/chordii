Wonderful Time
Words and Music (C)2007 Adam Monsen

Everybody, let's have a wonderful time
C    G     F
Take it slowly, while you're feelin' fine
C       G       F
One strage day shouldn't take you by surprise
C          E7            F
But all right, hey hey, hey hey
C              G        F

Ahhh ahhh ahhh
C    Am   G
Ahhh ahhh ahhh
C    Am   G

Wonderful time
F         C
