A chordii distribution kit should contain a file 'INSTALL' and
can be built according to the instructions in that file.

When chordii is checked out from the development repository, you need
first apply autoconf and frieds to get buildable sources. 'autoreconf'
is an excellent tool to do that:

  $ autoreconf -i -f -m

Upon completion, the file 'INSTALL' (and some other files) should be
present, and chordii can be built according to the instructions in
that file.
